### 🛠️ Projects

- **[Federated Learning-based Recommendation System](https://github.com/aravinthakshan/federated-recommendation)**  
  Built a privacy-preserving recommendation system with TensorFlow Federated and PySyft, implementing differential privacy techniques for data security.

- **[Semantic Search, Categorization, and Predictive Analysis](https://github.com/aravinthakshan/lt-fine-tuned-semantic-search)**  
  Created an intelligent semantic search system using a fine-tuned Gemini model, enabling contextual search and reducing retrieval time.

- **[Sentiment Analysis Model API](https://github.com/aravinthakshan/sentiment-analysis-deploy/)**  
  Developed a sentiment analysis classifier API deployed on Google Cloud, leveraging a custom GRU+RoBERTa model for enhanced NLP performance.

- **[Resume Evaluator](https://github.com/aravinthakshan/resume-reader-repo)**  
  Automated resume evaluation with custom-built scoring metrics and integrated with the Gemini API, deployed on Streamlit.

- **[Hand and Face Tracker with Background Object Detection](https://github.com/aravinthakshan/hand-tracker)**  
  Combined OpenCV, MediaPipe, and YOLO for precise facial tracking and multi-object detection.

- **[Two-Wheel Drive on ROS1](https://github.com/aravinthakshan/FinalTask_Automation)**  
  Designed a differential drive system in ROS Noetic with simulations in Gazebo and RViz, enhancing path planning and goal-setting skills.
